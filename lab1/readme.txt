Lab 1 – Image Intensity Transformations
Aim
To study and implement basic image intensity transformation methods, namely Negative Transformation, Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation, and Logarithmic Transformation, using Python and OpenCV.

Objectives
The objectives of this practical are:

To understand the basics of image intensity transformations.
To implement negative transformation on a grayscale image.
To implement Power-Law (Gamma) transformation.
To implement logarithmic transformation.
To study the effect of transformations on pixel intensity values.
To perform transformations using pixel matrices.
To implement the transformations using OpenCV and NumPy.
Theory
Image intensity transformation is a basic Digital Image Processing technique used to modify pixel values for image enhancement.

An intensity transformation maps an input intensity r to an output intensity s.

s = T(r)

where:

r = input pixel intensity
s = output pixel intensity
T = transformation function
For an 8-bit grayscale image, pixel values range from 0 to 255. Here, 0 represents black and 255 represents white.

Three intensity transformations are performed in this practical.

1. Negative Transformation
Negative transformation reverses the intensity values of an image.

The transformation is given by:

s = (L - 1) - r

For an 8-bit grayscale image:

s = 255 - r

where L = 256 represents the total number of intensity levels.

For example:

Original Pixel	Negative Pixel
0	255
50	205
100	155
150	105
255	0
This converts dark areas into bright areas and bright areas into dark areas.

2. Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation
Power-Law transformation, also called Gamma transformation, is represented by:

s = c × r^γ

The input intensity is first normalized to [0, 1]:

r_norm = r / 255
The transformation is then performed:

s_norm = c * (r_norm ** gamma)
The result is finally converted back to the range [0, 255].

Effect of Gamma
The Gamma value determines the brightness of the output image:

γ < 1 → image becomes brighter.
γ = 1 → image remains approximately unchanged.
γ > 1 → image becomes darker.
In this practical, the Gamma value used is:

γ = 0.5
A Lookup Table (LUT) can be used in OpenCV to apply the transformation efficiently.

3. Logarithmic Transformation
The logarithmic transformation is represented by:

s = c × log(1 + r)

where:

r = input pixel intensity
s = output pixel intensity
c = scaling constant
The scaling constant is calculated as:

c = 255 / log(1 + r_max)

where r_max is the highest pixel intensity in the image.

Logarithmic transformation increases lower intensity values and compresses higher intensity values. It is useful for improving details in darker regions.

Software and Libraries Used
The following software and Python libraries are used:

Python
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Python Libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Implementation
The practical is performed in two stages:

Manual implementation using a pixel matrix
Image processing using OpenCV and NumPy
Part A – Manual Matrix Implementation
A user-defined grayscale image matrix is taken as input.

The program accepts:

Number of rows
Number of columns
Pixel values between 0 and 255
Gamma value for Power-Law transformation
The input matrix is then processed using the three transformations.

1. Manual Natural Logarithm
A custom manual_ln() function is used to calculate the natural logarithm using a Taylor series.

The formula used is:

ln(x) = 2 × [z + z³/3 + z⁵/5 + ...]

where:

z = (x - 1) / (x + 1)

This provides the logarithm value without directly using Python's logarithm function.

2. Negative Transformation
The negative transformation is performed using:

new_pixel = max_intensity - pixel
For an 8-bit image:

new_pixel = 255 - pixel
The operation is applied to every pixel in the input matrix.

3. Power-Law Transformation
The input pixel is first normalized:

r_norm = pixel / max_intensity
The Power-Law transformation is then applied:

s_norm = c * (r_norm ** gamma)
The result is converted back to the intensity range [0, 255].

4. Logarithmic Transformation
A scaling constant is calculated using the maximum intensity:

c = max_intensity / manual_ln(1 + max_intensity)
The logarithmic transformation is then applied:

s = c * manual_ln(1 + pixel)
The output values are limited to the range 0 to 255.

Part B – Image Processing Using OpenCV
A grayscale image is loaded using OpenCV:

img = cv2.imread("Lab1/image.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
The three transformations are then applied to the image.

Negative Transformation Using OpenCV
The negative image is generated using:

neg_img = cv2.bitwise_not(img)
This reverses the intensity value of each pixel.

Power-Law Transformation Using OpenCV
A Lookup Table containing transformed values for all 256 grayscale levels is generated.

The Gamma value used is:

gamma = 0.5
The lookup table is created using:

lut = np.array(
    [((i / 255.0) ** 0.5) * 255 for i in np.arange(0, 256)]
).astype("uint8")
The LUT is then applied using:

gamma_img = cv2.LUT(img, lut)
Using a LUT reduces repeated calculations and makes the transformation faster.

Logarithmic Transformation Using OpenCV and NumPy
The maximum pixel value is obtained using:

max_pixel_val = float(np.max(img))
The scaling constant is calculated as:

c = 255 / np.log(1 + max_pixel_val)
The logarithmic transformation is applied using NumPy:

log_img = np.array(
    c * np.log1p(img.astype(np.float32)),
    dtype=np.uint8
)
np.log1p() is used to calculate log(1 + x) accurately.

Result
The Negative, Power-Law (Gamma), and Logarithmic intensity transformations were successfully implemented using manual pixel-matrix operations and Python libraries.

The Negative Transformation inverted the intensity values. The Power-Law transformation with γ = 0.5 produced a brighter image, while the Logarithmic Transformation improved details in darker regions.

Thus, the practical successfully demonstrated basic image intensity transformations using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.

Conclusion
In this practical, Negative, Power-Law (Gamma), and Logarithmic Transformation techniques were studied and implemented.

The experiment demonstrated how pixel intensity values can be modified mathematically for image enhancement. Both manual matrix operations and library-based methods were used to understand the practical implementation of intensity transformations in Python.
